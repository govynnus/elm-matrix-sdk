# Matrix SDK for Elm

This repository is a [Matrix](https://matrix.org/) SDK for [Elm](https://elm-lang.org/) compatible with [these spec versions](src/Internal/Api/README.md).

## How to install

This repository does not have its first version released! For now, you will need to install this library manually if you wish to use it.

## Why Elm?

As a functional programming language that promises zero runtime exceptions and great optimized performance, [Elm](https://elm-lang.org/) is a web application language that allows you to write reliable web applications or tiny programs.

This means that Elm makes it relatively easy to create all kinds of programs in almost no time!
